### Post Install
#### Wallpaper
- Get an image from [This wallpaper generator made by me](https://winnerwind.itch.io/mobmwg)
- Change the path in `~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf` to reflect the path of the new wallpaper.
#### Oh My Posh
- Change your `.bashrc` file and add this to the end
  ```
  eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash --config '~/.config/oh-my-posh/milk-theme.yaml')"
  ```
  If this line already exists, then simply replace the config path. A `json` variant has been added too.
